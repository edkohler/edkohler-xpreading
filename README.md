This site was built using Lithium as a starting point. If you're looking for a quick way to get started building a django project with some good libraries pre-installed, check that out.

This site is designed to help active readers track the books they've read on book awards lists. And to make it easier for them to track down the books they haven't read yet from their local libraries, bookstores, or online.
